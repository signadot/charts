                    StatusConditions must follow the following discipline in reconciliation:
                    The operator MUST always populate all the condition types in a
                    SignadotSandboxStatus struct, irrespective of whether
                    the condition is known or not (see corev1.ConditionUnknown) so that access via
                    a k8s client can determine whether the capability is supported in the operator.
