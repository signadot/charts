              RequestMiddlewareSpec represents the specification of a RequestMiddleware.
              The specification is opaque, allowing the traffic manager to determine how
              to execute middlewares by the RequestMiddleware name and associated
              instantiated parameters only.

                  Parameters is the list of parameters which can be used to

                    Parameter is a generic api struct representing parameters that
                    can be instantiated with Arguments.
                    A Parameter is identified by its name and may have a default.  If
                    a default is specified, then no corresponding argument is required.

                    StatusConditions must follow the following discipline in reconciliation:
                    The operator MUST always populate all the condition types in a
                    SignadotSandboxStatus struct, irrespective of whether
                    the condition is known or not (see corev1.ConditionUnknown) so that access via
                    a k8s client can determine whether the capability is supported in the operator.
