                          It exists so we can add the PreserveUnknownFields directive on the items in

                          Adding PreserveUnknownFields to the list itself works in the latest patch
                          releases of k8s v1.18+, but the fix was never backported to v1.17 or older:

                  PreservedLabels is a list of RE2 regular expressions to check against
                  label keys on the original baseline Pod template. The expression can
                  match any substring within the key, so use anchors if you want to require
                  a full match.

                  Normally, all baseline labels are stripped from the cloned Pod template
                  to ensure it can't match any existing Services. Labels from the baseline
                  Pod that match any of these regular expressions will be preserved on the
                  cloned Pod instead.

                  If preserving these labels would cause the cloned Pods to match a baseline
                  Service, the sandbox controller will pause and report an error to avoid
                  interference.
