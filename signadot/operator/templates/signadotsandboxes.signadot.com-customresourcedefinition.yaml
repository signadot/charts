          SignadotSandbox can be used to create a sandbox in which customized
          versions of one or more workloads (e.g. running work-in-progress code)
          run alongside the real workloads and serve only those requests that are
          explicitly tagged to run in this sandbox.

                    description: |-
                      Patches to apply when cloning workloads (e.g. Deployments) for this sandbox.

                      Each patch describes which object it applies to. If a matching object is
                      found, a clone of that object will be created for this sandbox and the
                      patch will be applied to the clone.

                      If multiple patches and/or image replacement rules match a given object,
                      only one clone of that object will be created, and then all matching
                      patches and image replacements will be applied on top of one another to
                      the clone. Patches will be applied last, in the order listed here, so
                      they take precedence over image replacements.

                      Each patch can be defined in any one of the formats supported by
                      `kubectl patch`. See: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/update-api-object-kubectl-patch/

                      Only one of the following fields should be set for each patch in the list:

                        strategic - Define the patch in Kubernetes strategic merge patch format.
                        merge - Define the patch in JSON Merge Patch format (RFC 7386).

                              It exists so we can add the PreserveUnknownFields directive on the items in
                              a []RawExtension list, rather than to the list itself.
                              Adding PreserveUnknownFields to the list itself works in the latest patch
                              releases of k8s v1.18+, but the fix was never backported to v1.17 or older:

                      PreservedLabels is a list of RE2 regular expressions to check against
                      label keys on the original baseline Pod template. The expression can
                      match any substring within the key, so use anchors if you want to require
                      a full match.

                      Normally, all baseline labels are stripped from the cloned Pod template
                      to ensure it can't match any existing Services. Labels from the baseline
                      Pod that match any of these regular expressions will be preserved on the
                      cloned Pod instead.

                      If preserving these labels would cause the cloned Pods to match a baseline
                      Service, the sandbox controller will pause and report an error to avoid
                      interference.
